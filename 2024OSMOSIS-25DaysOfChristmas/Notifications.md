# [December 25th, 8:57:17 PM] Final Bonus Challenge

First, thank you for another fun CTF. Our team learned so much this event and try to do even better as we continue forward.

We will have one final bonus challenge that will drop between 830pm - 10pm EST. It will remain open until the conclusion of the event. The flag format will be FLAG{9999} and you will only get ONE attempt. The value will be 500.

Good luck and happy holidays.

# [December 25th, 5:22:27 AM] Merry Christmas!

Your first walkthrough will be dropping on youtube shortly. It's in video form. Feel free to make one, guaranteed to be much better than what you're about to get......... Event ends in approx 20.5 hours. Its still anyone's game.

# [December 24th, 9:06:42 AM] Error on our part Challenge 23

Apologies, inadvertently their was a space between the last character and the closing brace. FLAG{Example } should have been FLAG{Example}

Jump in and try it again if you think you had it. I will manually review these later.

# [December 24th, 8:05:17 AM] Remember to review the flag format

After L00ck3r complained about one of the content creators being off a letter, a huge free hint is now the flag format (Claps from everyone, thank you L00ck3r).

Some of you have the correct answer but just are entering it incorrectly. For example #23 has two words, the first word has 7 letters and the second has 6.

# [December 23rd, 10:55:46 AM] Only three more days of OSINT Left

If you have been sandbagging now is the time to punch it into gear. Three days of OSINT remain. The elves are good again, off the shelf and working to make toys.

# [December 22nd, 1:58:50 AM] Tick tock Tick tock

When is the next challenge coming, another special content creator and I are "hashing" that out now...... just like the MD5 Hash Brown Challenge ;)

# [December 20th, 5:46:56 PM] New Challenge

Check out the new geo related challenge from @Jessica Jones, no she isn't associated with the elves.

Message her direct on discord server with any questions.

# [December 20th, 1:22:05 AM] .....

Stop giving the elves your points. Think outside the box for this one. Here comes day 20.

# [December 19th, 5:41:21 PM] Elf Warning

Someone reported seeing two elves leaving the server room at the OSMOSIS Ctf Headquarters today. Be careful again as the elves' are trying to take all the points so they can get first place. I don't know exactly what they are up to yet.

# [December 16th, 7:28:31 PM] Elf is back

Don't be tempted by the elf and his challenges. He is trying to get as many points as he can.

# [December 15th, 3:34:18 PM] Elfie

Đối với một số người chơi trong cuộc thi này, đây đã là ngày thứ 16 rồi! Elf nói rằng đây là ngày thứ 16!

สำหรับผู้เล่นบางคนในการแข่งขันครั้งนี้ วันนี้เป็นวันที่ 16 แล้ว! เอลฟ์บอกว่าวันนี้เป็นวันที่ 16 แล้ว!

对于参加本次比赛的一些选手来说，已经是第 16 天了！Elf 说是第 16 天！

For some of the contestants in this competition, it’s already Day 16! Elf says it’s Day 16!

# [December 15th, 3:32:12 PM] Elfie

ဒီပြိုင်ပွဲမှာ ကစားသမားအချို့အတွက်က 16 ရက်ရှိနေပါပြီ။ Elf က 16 ရက်မြောက်နေ့ဖြစ်သည် ။

# [December 15th, 3:31:33 PM] Elfie why

Bagi beberapa pemain dalam kompetisi ini, ini sudah hari ke-16! Elf bilang ini hari ke-16!

# [December 15th, 2:05:22 AM] Elf first strikes

The elf is here. He will not give any sanity check of flag formats when he drops a challenge. Do not be tempted by the hint, its not helpful at all.

# [December 13th, 1:47:31 PM] Elf was here

Day 13, that mischievous elf has arrived

# [December 12th, 11:08:14 PM] P.s.

I am not an elf.

# [December 12th, 11:07:44 PM] Hello everyone

Hello everyone! Just your friendly CTF creator guy (or girl) here. You can completely disregard that last notification. It was just one of our jolly December fools day joke :)

Click away 8-)

# [December 12th, 10:57:33 PM] Warning elf at large

Attention players of the Osmosis 25 days of OSINT. We regret to inform you that we were notified at approximately 5:30 PM Eastern standard time on December 12, 2024 that an elf escaped from the North Pole prison. He was last seen wearing red clothing with white accents.

This particular elf has been known to cause havoc on servers to break into online capture the flag events and hide hidden messages everywhere.

We are just alerting you as a precaution and if the elf is indeed found to be in this platform, we will let you know as soon as we can.

Enjoy the rest of the 25 days of OSINT.

# [December 12th, 3:14:54 PM] CTF Support / Ticket Creation on Discord Channel

Good afternoon, morning, and evening to you all. Please when creating a ticket provide your user name on here so that we can view the problems on the backend. If my username is M&M's on here but on discord its little-not-so-fluffy-sheep we won't find the cause of the error. Please include that in your creation of the ticket. Thank you!

# [December 10th, 5:31:57 AM] Another tool for your collection

https://osint.link/ Just another tool you might find helpful if you get stumped.

# [December 4th, 1:22:04 PM] Echo “Not ignoring you” not ignoring you

Sorry if you see this twice, but for a little bonus what is incorrect about the above title.

You either know or will use Linux cli to figure it out.

Drop response in appropriate location.

# [December 2nd, 7:00:45 PM] Flags and Formats

For clarification, the reason you are continually reminded of the flags format is so you don't throw "_ or - or /" in between words (unless warranted). Sometimes the amount of variables are equal to the example flag. Day 2's format "FLAG{XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX}" does not represent the flag actually being 8 words with 3 characters each.

Leverage every tool you have but that hint isn't a hint.
