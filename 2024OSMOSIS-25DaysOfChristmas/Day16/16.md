- The website linked in the challenge does not provide any information directly related to "Heidi Schuster."
- The site's source code also did not contain any useful clues.
- Given the prominent title "Think OPSEC" on the site, I investigated the term "Heidi Schuster" in the context of operations security (OPSEC) and cybersecurity.
    - Heidi Schuster is associated with the [Max Planck Society](https://www.mpg.de/en) and has been serving as a jurist in its General Administration since 2006.
    - This [link](https://www.mpg.de/officers-of-the-mpg) identifies Heidi Schuster as the **Data Protection Officer**, which matches the answer to the challenge.
