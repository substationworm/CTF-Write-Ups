# üìñ Day 13: On the Thirteenth Day of OSINT

- CTF: 25 Days of Christmas Capture the Flag.
- Organized by: [OSMOSIS Association](https://osmosisinstitute.org/).
- Release Date: December 13, 2024.
- Points: 95.

**Challenge:** Call Santa, see if you can get him on the phone. If you and you have been nice he will simply give you the flag but if he doesn't answer then you may be on the naughty list. Listen to his voicemail, what does he say before his final "Ho Ho Ho" but after stating he know's if you have been naughty or nice?

`FLAG{Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxx xxx x'xx xxx xxx xxxx}`

## ‚úçüèª Write-Up

- There is a free service that allows you to call Santa and listen to his voicemail.
- To access it, dial **1-605-313-4000**.
- The voicemail response is **(...) Merry Christimas and i'll see you soon** before his final "Ho Ho Ho".
- I suspected this might be related to the "escaped elf" scenario mentioned in the notifications, which could imply a risk of losing points if mishandled.

## üèÅ Flag

The confirmed flag is `FLAG{Merry Christimas and i'll see you soon}`. **Solved on:** December 13, 2024.
