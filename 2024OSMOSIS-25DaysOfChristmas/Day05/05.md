**Challenge:** Prior to choosing Reindeer, Sanata almost chose another animal to pull his sleigh. Here is a song that may give you some context to the animal. A little hint so you can guess what animal he almost used.

*Dog goes "woof," cat goes "meow"*

*Bird goes "tweet," and mouse goes "squeak"*

*Cow goes "moo," frog goes "croak,"*

*And the elephant goes "toot"*

*Ducks say "quack," and fish go "blub"*

*And the seal goes "ow ow ow."*

The animal Santa almost chose says:

*"Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!"*

*"Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!"*

*"Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!"*

*"Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!"*

What animal almost pulled Santa around?

`FLAG{XXX}`

## ‚úçüèª Write-Up

- The lyrics in the challenge are from the song "The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)" by Ylvis.
- The song humorously attributes mysterious and playful sounds to the **fox**, suggesting it as the animal in question.
