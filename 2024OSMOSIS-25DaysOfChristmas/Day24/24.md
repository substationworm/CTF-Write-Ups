## ‚úçüèª Write-Up

- To solve this challenge, exhaustive searches were conducted using Google and Google Earth, focusing on the following objectives:
    1. Identify annual Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremonies in the United States. However, this event occurs in numerous cities, making it challenging to narrow down the search.
    2. Search for "Dollar General" locations in arid/semi-arid U.S. states.
    3. Investigate "Community Hall" locations in arid/semi-arid U.S. states.
        - Unfortunately, these searches did not yield any useful results.
- Shifting the approach, I began exploring cities associated with UFO or alien-related events. This led to the discovery of [this site](https://myvalleynews.com/blog/2022/09/08/goldie-fest-delivers-interstellar-fun/), which mentions that the city of Anza has its very own UFO called **Goldie**.
    - Returning to Google Earth, I searched for "Dollar General" in Anza and identified the [location in the challenge image](https://earth.google.com/web/search/anza+dollar+general/@33.5553582,-116.67256767,1194.81255443a,492.23417369d,57.37434729y,-17.23835233h,32.8050587t,0.00000001r/data=CoIBGlQSTgolMHg4MGRiYTczZjU3YjUyZmIzOjB4OTUxYzEzNDlmZjJmNzk4ZRkmxjL9EsdAQCFEFmniHStdwCoTYW56YSBkb2xsYXIgZ2VuZXJhbBgBIAEiJgokCfNPp77MEklAEe0B_UXlC0lAGRgdFhEHul7AISlEYbPJvl7AQgIIAUICCABKDQj___________8BEAA).
