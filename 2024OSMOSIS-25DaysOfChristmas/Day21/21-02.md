**Challenge:** On the 21st day of OSINT the Elves come bringing gifts. Thats right, the elves want a truce. After a long discussion with Santa Clause and a certain mammal belonging to the weasel family, filled with intelligence has brokered the deal.

Having the opportunity top speak to @Intelbadgr, everyday for the last 20 days at least twice a day, I am confident when he says the deal is done it is done. If you have any questions go direct to him on discord.

In 1948, a U.S. radar station picked up a strange blip on its screens. The object was flying at a high altitude and moving erratically, unlike any known aircraft. Despite repeated scans, the object didn‚Äôt match any known aircraft signatures. A radio transmission eventually came through, but the full details remained unclear. After 7 years of this incident General Dwight D. Eisenhower received an unexpected call during the Cold War. The call came from a child who had mistakenly dialed a military hotline. According to the program website, Which organisation does the military command coordinates with to track the launch time of Santa‚Äôs sleigh every year?

## ‚úçüèª Write-Up

- According to this [site](https://orbitaltoday.com/2024/12/16/christmas-mission-how-and-why-military-defence-organisation-tracks-santa-claus/), Santa Claus is tracked by the North American Aerospace Defense Command ([NORAD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NORAD)).
- NORAD has an [official website](https://www.noradsanta.org/en/map) for tracking Santa Claus.
    - In the [Press Room](https://www.noradsanta.org/en/noradhq#PressRoom), the answer can be identified: "NORAD coordinates with **Santa's Elf Launch Staff** (...)"
