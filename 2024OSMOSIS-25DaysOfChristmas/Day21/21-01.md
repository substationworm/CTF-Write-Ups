# üìñ Day 21.1: On the twenty first day of OSINT

- CTF: 25 Days of Christmas Capture the Flag.
- Organized by: [OSMOSIS Association](https://osmosisinstitute.org/).
- Release Date: December 21, 2024.
- Points: 100.

**Challenge:** Though change is sometimes difficult; the world is changing in ways that challenge Santa‚Äôs traditional way of doing business. There is some story about North Pole legal documents from 2008; when was the last archived post published?

`FLAG{DD,MM,YY}`

## ‚úçüèª Write-Up

- For several days, I focused on finding "legal documents" related to the North Pole. During this investigation, I explored sources ranging from the [Ilulissat Declarion](https://cil.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2008-Ilulissat-Declaration.pdf) from 2008 to tangential topics such as [Who Owns Christmas?](https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/10/christmas-legal-lawsuits-biz-media-cx_wp_1210christmas.html) anda [Santa Forced to Evacuate North Pole](https://www.heritage.org/commentary/santa-forced-evacuate-north-pole), both published in 2008.
- I conducted multiple searches in the Wayback Machine for each "legal document" identified and even attempted to solve the challenge using archive dates for the [Ilulissat Declarion](https://cil.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2008-Ilulissat-Declaration.pdf). I recall at least two failed attempts:
    - [Attempt 01](https://web.archive.org/web/20240301000000*/https://arcticportal.org/images/stories/pdf/Ilulissat-declaration.pdf): `FLAG{17,07,24}`.
    - [Attempt 02](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/http://www.oceanlaw.org/downloads/arctic/Ilulissat_Declaration.pdf): `FLAG{07,12,24}`.
- I temporarily abandoned the challenge, assuming it was either unsolvable and excessively difficult. However, on December 24, 2024, another competitor successfully submitted the correct flag. This motivated me to revisit the challenge.
- This time, I shifted my focus to the term "last archived post" instead of "legal documents." Using the Wayback Machine, I searched for web pages related to the keywords `"north pole" legal`.
- This search on [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/) led to the following [site](https://web.archive.org/web/20090327175756/http://www.northpolelegal.com/) as the first result.
    - On this site, I found the answer to the challenge: **December 23, 2008**.
        - Initially, I still submitted incorrect answers a few times, as I was uncertain whether the challenge referred to the site's last capture date in the Wayback Machine (March 27, 2009) or the date of the post discussing the legal documents ("North Pole Legal Update").
